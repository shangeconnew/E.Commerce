      <description>Pinterest: A Picture Is Worth a Thousand WordsLike all successful e-commerce companies, Pinterest taps into a simple truth. InPinterest’s case, the simple truth is that people love to collect things and show offtheir collections to others. Founded in 2009 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp, andPaul Sciarra and launched in March 2010, Pinterest allows you to create virtualscrapbooks of images, video, and other content that you “pin” (save) to a virtualbulletin board or pin board.</description>
