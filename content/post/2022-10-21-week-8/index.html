<!-- - 1. Choose an e-commerce company and assess it in terms of the eight unique features -->
<!-- of e-commerce technology described in Table 1.2. Which of the features does the -->
<!-- company implement well, and which features poorly, in your opinion? Prepare a -->
<!-- short memo to the president of the company you have chosen detailing your -->
<!-- findings and any suggestions for improvement you may have. -->
<!-- - 2. Search the Web for an example of each of the major types of e-commerce described in Section 1.4 and listed in Table 1.3. Create a presentation or written report -->
<!-- describing each company (take a screenshot of each, if possible), and explain why it fits into the category of e-commerce to which you have assigned it. -->
<!-- - 3. Given the development and history of e-commerce in the years 1995-2020, what do -->
<!-- you predict we will see during the next five years of e-commerce? Describe some of -->
<!-- the technological, business, and societal shifts that may occur as the Internet -->
<!-- continues to grow and expand. Prepare a brief presentation or written report to -->
<!-- explain your vision of what e-commerce will look like in 2025. -->
<!-- - 4. Prepare a brief report or presentation on how companies are using Instagram or another company of your choosing as a social e-commerce platform.  -->
