<h2>Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Guidelines: the goal of this project is to allow you make a connection
between course topics and real world. The course project is to push you get immersed in real business life and is very important for us.</p></li>
<li><p>Topics I suggested are as follows:</p></li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose an e-commerce company and assess it in terms of the eight unique features
of e-commerce technology described in Table 1.2. Which of the features does the
company implement well, and which features poorly, in your opinion? Prepare a
short memo to the president of the company you have chosen detailing your
findings and any suggestions for improvement you may have.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Search the Web for an example of each of the major types of e-commerce described in Section 1.4 and listed in Table 1.3. Create a presentation or written report
describing each company (take a screenshot of each, if possible), and explain why it fits into the category of e-commerce to which you have assigned it.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given the development and history of e-commerce in the years 1995-2020, what do
you predict we will see during the next five years of e-commerce? Describe some of
the technological, business, and societal shifts that may occur as the Internet
continues to grow and expand. Prepare a brief presentation or written report to
explain your vision of what e-commerce will look like in 2025.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Prepare a brief report or presentation on how companies are using Instagram or another company of your choosing as a social e-commerce platform.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Follow up on events at Uber since July 2020 (when the opening case was prepared). Prepare a short report on your findings.</li>
