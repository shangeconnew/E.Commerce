## Prerequisites

- Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics at introductory levels as textbooks by N. Gregory Mankiw.

-  Introduction to Statistical Methods in Economics,

##  Course Overview

There are three parts of this course:  the first part focus on economics. We will brush up some basic theory of economics, like the market structure. The second part will introduce some basic coverage about internet business concepts and models. Some case studies about import internet companies will be investegated as applications.

##  Textbook and Reading List

- The textbook is *E-Commerce 2021: Business, Technology and Society*, $16^{th}$ edition, by Kenneth C. Laudon and Carol Guercio Traver, Pearson. You do not need to own a book, I will post relevant parts for you to read.

- Reference: *Industrial Organization: Contemporary Theory and Empirical Applications*, Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. ISBN: 9781405176323.
 
I will not assign readings out of them. Rather, I suggest looking at them when economic models covered in lecture are not clear. There will also be newspaper and academic articles assigned throughout the semester, as well as required web surfing.  


##  Assignments

There will be $4$ homework assignments with each worth $50$ points. The assignments are very important for learning and understanding the material, which is why they
receive a relatively high weight in the grading scheme. I do not mind if you
work with others on the assignments, but each of you should turn in your own
work. All assignments are on Connect with specified due dates. Late
assignment will NOT be accepted. Homework assignments will be posted on [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/438538). Please register your account under course code **J36N8X**.

## Exams

There will be one in class midterm exams and one cumulative final exam. The midterm is
worth $100$ points and the final exam will have $200$ points. The exam dates will be decided soon.

## Project

The course project is to push you get immersed in real business life and is very important for us. That is why I assign 100 points for it. I have some plan now and will post more details soon.

## Grading Scheme

There are $600$ points in total in this course, including $200$ of HW
assignments, $300$ points of exam and $100$ points of course project. Your course's
final grade will be calculated using the following scale:

|A|B|C|D|F|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|90-100\%|80-89\%|70-79\%|60-69\%|below 60\%|

## A Note from the Instructor

Every undergraduate course I teach, thereâ€™s something about it I really like.  I think this one is going to be that e-commerce has been my primary area of research for the last several years.  We also have a small class, so I hope that means we will have lively discussions, and that no one feels initmidated. During the first class each student introduces themselves by providing their:

- Name
- Major
- Something to remember them by
- Favorite TV show or board / card game

##  Instructor's Advice
- Come to class as possible as you can; It takes time to learn to work
problems.
- Cramming doesn't work: Just a little time week by week will be much
more effective than spending the same amount of time  before a deadline.
- The best way to get a hold of me is by email or by stopping by my
office hours. As for your email, put "\textbf{E-Commerence}:
Key words of your question" as the subject. I will check my email as much as
possible from 9am to 6pm during the weekdays, but I make no
guarantees about reading or responding on the same day to emails sent later
at night or over the weekend.
- The biggest expectation I can have of you is to ask questions! Please!
I promise you that $99\%$ (is that a statistic!?) of the time multiple
people are confused about the same thing as you. Or at the very least, one
question may cause other questions to be asked. This is a good thing! I try
to take all questions seriously as long as they are asked seriously. Other
than that, just be excellent to each other in class and we will get through
this class just fine.

_Disclaimer: I reserve the right to change the syllabus as
circumstances necessitate, it is your responsibility to keep up with any
changed policies announced in class or other form of notification._
