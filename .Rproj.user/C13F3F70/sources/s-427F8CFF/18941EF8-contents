- Course website: [\blc Canvas @ Kansas State University \rc ](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/128778), this will contain a bulletin board, lecture slides, homework assignments, reading list, R, R Studio, R Markdown resources etc. Questions can also be posted on [Canvas Discussion](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/128778/discussion_topics).

## Prerequisites
[MATH 100](https://www.k-state.edu/stats/academics/courses.html) or equivalent; Students Cannot be taken for credit if credit has been received for STAT 325, or 340.

##  Course Overview
Introduction to various statistical and probabilistic concepts and
techniques with application to business and economic problems including data
summarization, random variables and probability distributions, measures of
central tendency and dispersion, confidence intervals, testing of
hypotheses, simple linear regression, and correlation.

## Course Objective
By the end of the course, students should be able to: 

- Convey methods for organizing, summarizing, and presenting business
data;
- Convey methods for statistically analyzing business and economic data;
- Apply statistical inference to aim practical business and economics decision making;
- Critically evaluate published results based upon statistic methods;
- Present and communicate, both orally and in written-form, the results of statistical analyses of data.

##  Textbook
- The textbook is *Essentials of Business Statistics: Communicating With Numbers*, $4^{th}$ edition, by Sanjiv Jaggia and Alison Kelly, McGraw-Hill. In
addition to the textbook, we will be using [**Connect**](https://connect.mheducation.com/class/s-shang-section-abcdef), an online homework
system accompanying the textbook. An electronic copy of the textbook is
online with a registered Connect account. Thus, there is no textbook to
buy. If you would like to purchase a hard copy of the textbook, I recommend
finding a used copy. You should be able to find one on Amazon or KSU bookstore . To access Connect and the textbook, read the "Connect
Registration" file in the  "Lecture 0" folder in Canvas.

- Reference: *Business Analytics: Communitcating with Numbers*, $2^{nd}$ edition, by Sanjiv Jaggia, Alison Kelly, Kevin Lertwachara, and Leida Chen.
 
  
##  Software
- In this course, we will use R for computing and R Markdown for producing lecture slides, handouts. R Markdown is highly recommended. Install the following software:
    - R (required): [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
    - R Studio is highly recommended for syntax highlighting, package management, document generation, and more: [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/).
        - The newest version of R Studio is highly recommended.
    - Latex, which will enable you to create PDFs directly from the R Markdown in RStudio.
        - Install [\blc TinyTex\bc](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) package: `install.packages("tinytex")`.
        - After installing [\blc TinyTex\bc](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), close RStudio.
        - Reopen RStudio.
        - Run the following: `tinytex::install_tinytex()`.

##  Assignments
There will be $10$ homework assignments with each worth $50$ points. The assignments are very important for learning and understanding the material, which is why they
receive a relatively high weight in the grading scheme. I do not mind if you
work with others on the assignments, but each of you should turn in your own
work. All assignments are on Connect with specified due dates. Late
assignment will NOT be accepted.

## Exams

There will be two in class midterm exams and one cumulative final exam. Each midterm is
worth $100$ points and the final exam will have $200$ points. The midterms
will be given on **September 28 (Wednesday)**, and **November 16 (Wednesday)** respectively. The final exam will be held during the scheduled
time, **Tuesday, Dec 13, 6:20pm-8:10pm** in our usual
classroom: 105 UM. Makeup exam would only be issued with valid excuse and
the instructor should be notified at least two weeks ahead; other wise, the
grade for the missed exam would be zero. The exam will be closed book and closed note, but you will be provided with a formula sheet and a calculator. The calculator would only do basic functions $(+,-,\times,\div)$ and advanced functions (logarithms, exponents, factorials, 
etc.). No calculator with statistical manipulations or  electronics/tablets are allowed in exams.

## Attendance and Quizzes

The attendance is required for this course, and the student's participation
in the class is strongly recommended. There are 10 pop quizzes in lecture classes and recitations with a total of $100$ points. If you miss one quiz, it will be
considered as an absence. You're allowed to miss three quizzes without
penalty. Starting at the third absences, other than the zero score for the
missed quiz, your final grade will be reduced by ONE letter grade for each
absence. For example, if you earn a C in the class and you miss three
quizzes your final grade will be a D. The absences with valid excuses will
be exempted and the instructor should be notified in time. There may be also
times where I throw in two or three bonus points for attendance. Low
attendance days are strong candidates for this.

## Grading Scheme
There are $1000$ points in total in this course, including $500$ of HW
assignments, $400$ points of exam and $100$ points of quizzes. Your course's
final grade will be calculated using the following scale:

|A|B|C|D|F|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|90-100\%|80-89\%|70-79\%|60-69\%|below 60\%|

##  Instructor's Advice
- Come to class as possible as you can; It takes time to learn to work
problems.
- Cramming doesn't work: Just a little time week by week will be much
more effective than spending the same amount of time  before a deadline.
- The best way to get a hold of me is by email or by stopping by my
office hours. As for your email, put "\textbf{STAT 350}:
Key words of your question" as the subject. I will check my email as much as
possible from 9am to 6pm during the weekdays, but I make no
guarantees about reading or responding on the same day to emails sent later
at night or over the weekend.
- The biggest expectation I can have of you is to ask questions! Please!
I promise you that $99\%$ (is that a statistic!?) of the time multiple
people are confused about the same thing as you. Or at the very least, one
question may cause other questions to be asked. This is a good thing! I try
to take all questions seriously as long as they are asked seriously. Other
than that, just be excellent to each other in class and we will get through
this class just fine.

## Academic Honesty
Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the [Honor and Integrity System](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/) apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of **XF** can result from a breach of academic honesty. The **F** indicates failure in the course; the **X** indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation
 
## Special Accommodations
 At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and the means to demonstrate course mastery. Students with disabilities may benefit from services including accommodations provided by the Student Access Center. Disabilities can include physical, learning, executive functions, and mental health. You may register at the [Student Access Center ](k-state.edu/accesscenter) or to learn more contact: <accesscenter@k-state.edu>  or  785-532-6441.

Students already registered with the Student Access Center please request your Letters of Accommodation early in the semester to provide adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations. Once SAC approves your Letter of Accommodation it will be e-mailed to you, and your instructor(s) for this course.  Please follow up with your instructor to discuss how best to implement the approved accommodations.


## Expectations for Classroom Conduct
All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

## Wearing of Face Masks
Kansas State University strongly encourages, but does not require, that everyone wear masks while indoors on university property, including while attending in-person classes.  This policy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. For additional information and the latest on [\blc K-State’s face covering policy\bc](https://www.k-state.edu/covid-19/guidance/health/face-covering.html).

## Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment Statement

Kansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Instructors support the University’s commitment by creating a safe learning environment during this course, free of conduct that would interfere with your academic opportunities. Instructors also have a duty to report any behavior they become aware of that potentially violates the University’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment ([PPM 3010](https://www.k-state.edu/policies/ppm/3000/3010.html)).  

If a student is subjected to discrimination, harassment, or sexual harassment, they are encouraged to make a non-confidential report to the University’s Office for Institutional Equity ([OIE](https://www.k-state.edu/oie/)) using the [online reporting form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?KansasStateUniv&layout_id=34). Incident disclosure is not required to receive resources at K-State. Reports that include domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, should be considered for reporting by the complainant to the [Kansas State University Police Department](https://www.k-state.edu/police/suggest/) or the [Riley County Police Department](https://www.rileycountypolice.org/). Reports made to law enforcement are separate from reports made to OIE. A complainant can choose to report to one or both entities. Confidential support and advocacy can be found with the [K-State Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE)](https://www.k-state.edu/care/). Confidential mental health services can be found with Lafene Counseling and Psychological Services ([CAPS](https://www.k-state.edu/counseling/)). Academic support can be found with the [Office of Student Life (OSL)](https://www.k-state.edu/studentlife/). OSL is a non-confidential resource. A comprehensive list of resources is available here. If you have questions about non-confidential and confidential resources, please contact OIE at <equity@ksu.edu> or (785) 532–6220. 

_Disclaimer: I reserve the right to change the syllabus as
circumstances necessitate, it is your responsibility to keep up with any
changed policies announced in class or other form of notification._
